                    Uncertain information is frequently confirmed or retracted after people have initially heard it.
                    A large existing literature has studied how people change their beliefs in response to new
                    information, however, how people react to information about previous information is still unclear.
                    We investigate three closely related questions: 1) How do people update their belief in response to
                    being told a previous signal was (un)informative, 2) What is the effect of verifying the
                    informativeness of a signal ex-ante rather than checking information  ex-post, and
                    3) Do past information checks affect how people react to new uncertain information in the future?

                    To answer these questions we conduct two (online) experiments using a novel modification of the
                    classical ball and urn framework. It is deliberately abstract to avoid the influence of motivated
                    reasoning or other situation specific circumstances. We find that the majority of subjects react
                    to information about information incorrectly. Importantly, we can predict people's belief after
                    the uncertain information is retracted or confirmed based on their initial response.
                    For retractions, people that over-reacted initially end up with a belief higher than their initial
                    prior and vice versa, people that under-reacted initially end up with a belief lower than before.
                    After multiple consecutive retracted signals this leads to beliefs being more dispersed compared
                    to equivalent information that is ex-ante labeled as uninformative. Confirmations or retractions
                    in the past do not seem to affect how people respond to new uncertain information in our setup.

                <p class="abstract">
                    Having information about an uncertain event is crucial for informed decision-making. This paper
                    introduces a simple framework in which 1) a principal uses the reported beliefs of multiple agents
                    to make a decision and 2) the agents reporting a belief are affected by the decision. Naturally, the
                    question arises how the principal can incentivize the agents to report their belief truthfully.

                    I show that in this setting a direct reporting mechanism using a scoring rule to incentivize belief
                    reports and a fixed decision rule lead to truthful reporting by all agents as the unique Nash
                    equilibrium under precisely two conditions, preference diversity and no pivotality. Contrary to
                    that, popular alternative mechanisms, such as the Delphi method and prediction markets are likely to
                    lead to biased belief reports. Moreover, if the principal can only consult a single agent the only
                    mechanism that can guarantee truth-telling requires perfect knowledge of the agentâ€™s preferences.

                <p>Beliefs and the Role of Memory<br>
                    <span class="coauthors">(with Collin Raymond)</span>
                </p>
                <p class="abstract">
                    The memory of information is essential for problems involving sequential learning with
                    uncertainty. Economic models of sequential learning under uncertainty have two key aspects: signals
                    and beliefs. However, models differ in the assumption regarding memory of information. Some assume
                    that a decision maker remembers only a posterior belief that he continuously updates when observing
                    new information, while others assume that a decision maker remembers individual signals and only
                    forms a posterior belief once prompted by a decision. We develop a theoretical framework in which a
                    decision maker can freely choose what information to remember, however remembering information is
                    costly. We study the problem of optimal memory for the decision maker and analyze the role of
                    different decision environments. We find that across two different treatments, lab subjects respond
                    in a way predicted by theory. Specifically, we focus on two factors of the environment: 1)
                    uncertainty about the decision-relevant dimension, and 2) the number of signals. We find that in an
                    environment with more uncertainty about the upcoming decision and fewer signals, people remember
                    individual signals more frequently while in an environment with a clear decision and many signals,
                    people remember posterior beliefs more frequently.
