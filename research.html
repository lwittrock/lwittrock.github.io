                    Uncertain information frequently gets verified after people have heard it. A large existing literature
                    has studied how people change their beliefs in response to new information, however, how people react
                    to information about previous information is still unclear. We investigate two closely related questions:
                    1) How do people update their belief in response to being told a previous signal was (un)informative, and
                    2) Do verifications of signals affect inference from other signals?

                    We find that how people react to information retractions mainly depends on how people reacted to the
                    uncertain information initially. The more people react to uncertain information, the more they continue
                    to be influence by it even after the retraction, and vice versa. Moreover, verifications of past signals
                    have no clear influence on regular updating in the future.

                    Having information about an uncertain event is crucial for informed decision making.
                    This paper introduces a simple framework in which 1) a principal uses the reported beliefs of
                    multiple agents to make a decision and 2) the agents reporting a belief are affected by the decision.
                    Naturally, the question arises how the principal can incentivize the agents to report their
                    belief truthfully.

                    I show that in this setting a direct reporting mechanism using a scoring rule to incentivize belief
                    reports leads to truthful reporting by all agents as the unique Nash equilibrium under precisely
                    two conditions, preference diversity and no pivotality. Moreover, if the principal can only consult
                    a single agent the only mechanism that can guarantee truth-telling requires perfect knowledge
                    of the agentâ€™s preferences. In practice, it is best for the principal to delegate the decision to the agent
                    and provide incentives that best align the preferences.
